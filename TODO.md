# TODO

## Protocol

- Pairing: Save paired peers
- Refactor impls and util functions (traits?)
- Use 2 enums for everything (NetworkEvent and NetworkCommand)
- [Partial Done] Come up with a better way to send data p2p, ideally be able to keep a stream open between x amount of peers and send a receive data async

## Android

- Android app

## Misc

- Fix rust build github action
